Look at all the faceless gazes that are passing by
Fx this hole in my heart if I go left or right
The sky is the limit, this town and everything in it, so bizarre...
Yeah!

(It's just a morning passing by)
And reluctantly I'm smiling!
(The victor undecided)
And I'm drawn to the mystery!
(A hidden starting line and)
It's lurking in the shadows, somewhere within this town!

The time flies and we're flowing free
Bickering the day away as we
Are dancing all the way around
This crazy noisy bizarre town!
